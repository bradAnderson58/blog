Initial Commit
A Blog about Blogging

This is a blog I made.  Being the extremely important, interesting, and influencial person that I am, I realized there was nowhere for my legions of adoring fans to keep up with my daily thoughts and activities - other than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, the new Stack Overflow 'Story' page, Google+, and my YouTube channel.  So I created this website to address a burning need in todays society.  You are welcome.

But seriously, this is a tech blog about things I find interesting.  And who knows, maybe a few people will even stumbled upon it and agree with me that these things are interesting.  Or disagree with me vehemently and tell me about it in angry, trollish all-caps comments at the bottom of the page.

So, this being a tech blog, and this being my first blog post (my 'initial commit' if you will), I thought why not do a blog about the efforts of making a blog?  Now, this may seem to be a pretty lame topic, everybody knows you can google www.easyassblogsite.com and set yourself up with a decent blog in about 5 minutes, so whats the big deal?  Well, this being primarily an exercise in improving my own skills, I decided to make a blog the hard way: from scratch.

So it was that I found myself, on a quiet Thursday night, sitting in front of a completely blank index.html page open in Sublime.  I wrote this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>

	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
</html>

I stared at this for about 5 seconds, and then I realized: I don't want to write a whole website from scratch.  Its going to take way too long, and its going to end up looking terrible because Im not a good designer.  So I went on google and started looking up templates.

I decided not to spend too much time 'researching', I wanted to get right in there and start websiting!  So I went with the first promising-sounding result I got, which was this tutorial page (https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/building-angularjs-app-tutorial) which Im going to link to, but suggest you dont visit.  Im not trying to say the guy who wrote it isnt a good developer, Im absolutely convinced he's a great developer - what Im saying is it doesnt seem like he put a lot of time and effort into this particular tutorial, and it shows.  For instance, half of his code snippets dont work:

<div <span class="highlight">ng-include='"templates/header.html"'</span>></div>
<div <span class="highlight">ng-view</span>></div>
<div <span class="highlight">ng-include='"templates/footer.html"'</span>></div>
<!-- lol wut? -->

Now, sure, if you're already familiar with web development it's pretty easy to see what happened here.  He was copy pasting something and got the `span` from wherever he was copying from in his clipboard and we can fix it like this:

<div ng-include='"templates/header.html"'></div>
<div ng-view></div>
<div ng-include='"templates/footer.html"'></div>

But thats not the point, I would argue that if you're reading a tutorial, you don't necessarily already know how to debug jacked up html, you're trying to learn.

"Hey calm down there Bradius" you might say, "the guy made the time and effort to post a free tutorial on the internet, why dont you stop looking a gift horse in the mouth and just use his code, thats why you clicked on the link anyway you turd".  Sure, fair enough straw-man tutorial defender guy - and I didn't mean to get all negative here in my very first blog post.  The point I was trying to make was that he posted all the code for the website template from the tutorial on his Github (https://github.com/airpair/T0021-airpair-angularjs-tutorial) and its a really great template.  It looks great, its wired up with AngularJS, and its free of unnecessary `span`s.  Im using a heavily edited version of it for the very site you're looking at right now.  Just feel free to skip the tutorial, is all Im saying.

So anyway, I had my template, so now I could do some fun stuff, like stick in a bunch of photo's of my stunning visage, play with pretty color pallettes, and write some aggressively mediocre content.
